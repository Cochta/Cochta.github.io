**Head shot Blogpost and documentation**
Version 1.0

Introduction
==============================================================

This blog post primarily explains how I created "Head Shot" and how I implemented the rollback.

Head Shot is a small online game developed for the SAE Institute.

Head Shot is a "Head-soccer like" game, 2 players can shoot a ball and score goals with it.
A game lasts 1:30 minutes at the end of the time the player having the highest score wins.

The project was done in 1 month

Goals
--------------------------------------------------------------

Make a realtime responsive online multiplayer game.

Implement a rollback engine.


Using
==============================================================

Head Shot uses:
- The raylib library to render and to play sounds.
- The Bark physics engine developped by myself to simulate the physics. 
- The Photon library for the netorking

Architecture
==============================================================

The main application handles the networking, the rollback, the game logic and the rendering.

The rollback engine has access to the current game and handles the confirm game.

Game Logic
==============================================================

Instead of creating complex architecture for the game logic I decided to include all the needed elements into the game class directly.

Here are some examples:

Rollback engine

Confirm frame

Rendering
==============================================================

I thought that making the game playable in a web browser could be a good idea,
that is why i chose raylib to render my game because it is compatible with empscripten and seamed easy to use.

Conclusion
==============================================================

Thank you for reading so far !!!

I honestly hope, you enjoyed it :)
