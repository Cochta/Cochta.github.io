### Overview

This Unity project is a small collection of classic game prototypes created to explore and practice Unity development. It currently includes three games: **Minesweeper**, **Snake**, and **Chess**. The **Minesweeper implementation is fully completed**, while **Snake** and **Chess** are in progress.

### How it looks like

### What did I learn

- **Unity Fundamentals**: Gained hands-on experience with scenes, GameObjects, components, and prefabs.

- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developed core mechanics for classic games like Minesweeper and Snake.

- **Grid-Based Systems**: Learned to manage 2D grids for board games.
