### Overview

This project is a lightweight **Minecraft-inspired** world built from scratch using **DirectX 11**. It features **procedurally generated terrain** using **Perlin noise**, **real-time rendering** of blocks, and **camera controls**. The goal was to learn and explore **low-level rendering** concepts and **terrain generation** in a **3D environment**.

### How it looks like
