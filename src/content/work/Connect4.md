### Overview

This project is a simple yet fully functional online **2-player Connect 4 game** built using the **SFML** library for graphics and networking, alongside a custom-built **TCP packet mannager**. The goal was to explore **network programming fundamentals** while creating a **turn based multiplayer game**.

### How it looks like

### What did I learn

- **Turn based 2-player online gameplay** over **TCP**

- **Server side lobby** handeling system

- **SFML-based graphical interface** for the Connect 4 board

- **Win detection** and **turn-based control**

- Basic **server side** validation

- Implementing my own physics engine for the first time in another project
