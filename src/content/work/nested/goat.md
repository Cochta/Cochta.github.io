### Overview

This game was developed in **just 48 hours** during **Ludum Dare 54 (2023)**, following the theme: **"Limited Space"**.

We created a **Bullet Hell** game where you play as a **goat tethered by a rope**, desperately trying to **dodge a chaotic barrage of projectiles** hurled by an enraged crowd. The rope not only **limits your movement** but also adds a **layer of challenge** and strategy to every dodge.

### Team

- Joey Gugler Art
- Leonar Sadriu SFX and Music
- **Constantin Verine (me): Code**
- Olivier Pachoud: Code
- Remy Lambert: Code
- Alexis Haldy: Code

### How it looks like

### What did I learn 

- Adapting to the **pressure** of a **strict 48-hour deadline**.
- **Collaborating** effectively within a **team** environment.
- Practicing **group brainstorming** to quickly shape and refine ideas.
- **Organizing** and sharing tasks efficiently.
- **Integrating assets** and **contributions** from multiple teammates.
- Realizing that having 4 programmers for a small game jam can lead to inefficiencies.
