### Overview

Rambouille is a 2D platformer developed in Unity during the first year of my Bachelor's degree in Games Programming at SAE Institute Geneva. The project was an introduction to game development, focusing on gameplay mechanics, physics, and level design.

The game features fast-paced platforming challenges, requiring precise movement and timing. Throughout development, we worked on refining player controls, collision handling, and designing engaging levels to create a smooth and rewarding gameplay experience.

This project provided valuable experience in Unity's C# scripting, physics systems, and optimization techniques, laying the groundwork for more advanced game development projects in the future.

### How it looks like
