### Overview

Rambouille is a **2D platformer** developed in **Unity** during the **first year of my Bachelor's degree in Games Programming** at SAE Institute Geneva. The project was an **introduction to game development**, focusing on **gameplay mechanics**, **physics**, and **level design**.

The game features fast-paced **platforming challenges**, requiring **precise movement and timing**. Throughout development, I worked on refining **player controls**, **collision handling**, and **designing engaging levels** to create a smooth and rewarding **gameplay experience**.

This project provided valuable experience in **Unity's C# scripting**, **physics systems**, and **optimization techniques**, laying the **groundwork** for more **advanced game development projects in the future**.

### How it looks like

Here is a **playable** demo.
