### Overview

*Ruby and the Lost Crystals* is a **collaborative game project** developed during the **third year of the Bachelor's programme in Games Programming at SAE Institute Geneva**. It brought together students from the school's **Game Programming**, **Game Art**, and **Audio Engineering** departments.

For the **Game Programmers**, this project served as the **main focus of the semester**, while for the **Game Artists** and **Audio Engineers**, it was a **side project** alongside their other academic commitments.

The goal was to create a **vertical slice** within a **six-month timeframe** (from September to February) — delivering a **polished gameplay** segment that showcases the **core mechanics** and **vision** of the final game. The project was designed to provide a **semi-professional production experience**, encouraging students to **specialise** in their respective fields and **collaborate** as they would in a **real development environment**.

### Pitch

In a fantasy world strewn with ruins, Ruby and her mysterious companion Sapphire must work together to progress, with the sole mission of restoring the scattered crystals. To do this, Ruby is able to perform physical interactions, while Sapphire can fire projectiles with a variety of behaviours
