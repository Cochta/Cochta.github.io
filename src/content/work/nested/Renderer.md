### Overview

This project features a **fully rendered 3D scene** using **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)** and **Image-Based Lighting (IBL)**, built from **scratch** with a **custom OpenGL engine**. I developed it during my **second year** at SAE Institute Geneva as part of the **Computer Graphics** module.

The objective was to explore **rasterization-based rendering** in depth. I began with fundamental concepts like rendering a **triangle**, working with **uniforms**, and applying **matrix transformations**. As I progressed, I implemented more **advanced techniques** such as **shadow mapping**, **deferred shading**, **PBR**, and **IBL**. The final result is a **fully realized 3D scene** that demonstrates my understanding of **modern graphics rendering techniques**.

### How it looks like
Here is a **showcase** of the scene
